WARNING:  This is all lightly tested changes to kernel drivers.  
          Use with extreme caution!


		Making it work

1/ Make sure that you have the industrialio kernel modules available 

2/ Get the kernel-devel package for your kernel
	sudo install kernel-devel

3/ Compile the modules - there will be warnings
	make

4/ Blacklist the hid-sensor modules so that the stock ones are not loaded at startup
	/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf should look like
blacklist ideapad_laptop
blacklist hid_sensor_hub
blacklist hid_sensor_trigger
blacklist hid_sensor_accel_3d
blacklist hid_sensor_gyro_3d
blacklist hid_sensor_magn_3d
blacklist hid_sensor_als

5/ Reboot.  Don't use secure kernel mode, as you will be adding in unsigned modules.
	In Fedora secure kernel mode is set if you use secure UEFI booting,
	so turn that off.

6/Insert the modules, and their dependencies
	sudo modprobe industrialio
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-hub.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-trigger.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid_sensor_accel_3d.ko

7/ Insert drivers for the other sensors, if desired
	sudo insmod ./hid_sensor_gyro_3d.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid_sensor_magn_3d.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid_sensor_als.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid_sensor_incl_3d.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid_sensor_custom.ko



		Drivers for Sensors

Here are drivers for the Yoga sensors, including the patch to make the hub work better.

To install the drivers themselves, just 
   sudo modprobe -r hid-sensor<driver>
   sudo insmod ./hid-sensor<driver>.ko

To get the sensor hub to behave better is more involved.


There are two kinds of drivers

1/ Drivers from 3.14 - these should be good quality
2/ Drivers for the other sensors - these probably need work

The build system is also hacked together and needs to be improved.  Some
include files have been copied into this directory.  This should all be
fixed up.  Some shortcuts had to be made because the common infrastructure
doesn't support these kinds of drivers.


Files for drivers:

hid-sensor-ids.h	From 3.14
hid-ids.h		From 3.14, plus patch to quirk the Yoga sensor
hid-sensor-hub.c	From 3.14, plus patch to quirk the Yoga sensor
 				Also patched to use local hid-sensor-ids.h

hid-sensor-trigger.h	From 3.14
hid-sensor-trigger.c	From 3.14 (had a temporary patch)

hid-sensor-als.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-accel-3d.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-gryo-3d.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-magn-3d.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-incl-3d.c	From 3.14 (new in 3.14)

hid-sensor-orient.c	
	driver for orientation sensor that reports back a quaternion
	the data is probably wrong here

hid-sensor-custom.c
	driver for custom sensor
	the fields are stolen from other sensors

hid-sensor-generic.c
	driver for generic sensor (only a start)
	the common support can't handle some of the fields of this driver
