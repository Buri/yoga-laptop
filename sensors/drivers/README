Here are several hacked-together drivers for the Yoga sensors that don't
have drivers in 3.12.  

The build system is also hacked together and needs to be improved.  Some
include files have been copied into this directory.  This should all be
fixed up.


Some shortcuts had to be made because the common infrastructure doesn't
support these kinds of drivers. 

Drivers:

hid-sensor-incl-3d.c
	driver for inclinometer

hid-sensor-orient.c
	driver for orientation sensor that reports back a quaternion
	the data is probably wrong here

hid-sensor-custom.c
	driver for custom sensor
	the fields are stolen from other sensors

hid-sensor-generic.c
	driver for generic sensor
	the common support can't handle some of the fields of this driver 


Utility Program:
	hid-example.c
	utility program to print raw sensor samples
	needs some work
