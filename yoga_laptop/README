		Lenovo Yoga Kernel Module

This is the start of a Yoga-specific kernel module.  The ideapad_laptop
kernel module doesn't work because the Yoga EC information is different
from the standard Ideapad EC information.  As well, the Yoga does not have
any physical RF kill switches.

There is probably a lot more stuff that should be removed from this module.



The module depends on the sparse keymap kernel module.  To ensure that this
is available
  sudo modprobe sparse_keymap
Then to load the module itself
  sudo insmod ./yoga_laptop.ko 


Right now the only thing that this module is known to be useful for is to
handle two keys (FnF7 and Novo) that only produce ACPI notifications.


Problematic Yoga Special Keys

Fn F5	Produces the same scan codes as F5
Fn F6	Produces unrecognised scan codes, fix to produce XF86TouchPadToggle
		sudo setkeycodes e03f 191
Fn F7	Produces ACPI Notify 0x2000, fixed in this module
Fn F9	Appears to work entirely in firmware
Break	Works the same as Pause, fix to produce Break
		sudo setkeycodes e046 124; xmodmap -e "keycode 132 = Break"
Fn sp	Appears to work entirely in firmware
Novo	Produces ACPI Notify 0x0008, fixed in this module
Windows	The on-screen button is indistinguishable from the keyboard key
